And with a lower amount of storage, this generally results in faster computation and a smaller overall model. Mobile-based neural networks often operate with 8-bit integers, smaller and faster to run but less accurate than their float32 counterparts. For more on this, I'd read up about [precision in computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_(computer_science)).\n",
